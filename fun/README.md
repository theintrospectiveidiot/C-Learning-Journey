Recently, read the Ken Thompson's Turing Award lecture titled "Reflecions on Trusting Trust" and felt like a quine was such cool thing to write.
 
First, I made a simple quine that reproduces itself without any changes, then a trojanized quine which reproduces itself replacing "char" with " int" every time it encounters "char".

Then, thought that it would be really really cool to have a program that updates itself when its compiled and run once and has some way to tell how many times it has been compiled and run.

So, I created this version of trojanized quine which does that.

## Notes
- The debugging was really satisfying.
- This is really cool man, I just can't stop admiring it!!
